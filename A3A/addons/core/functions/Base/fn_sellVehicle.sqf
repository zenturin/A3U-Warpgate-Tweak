Attempts to sell the vehicle the player is looking at.
Vehicle cannot be sold if owned by another player.

Arguments:
    <OBJECT> Player who is trying to sell a vehicle.
    <OBJECT> cursorObject of the player.

Return Value:
<NIL> nil

Scope: Server/HC, All calls need to be executed on one machine, using an HC is also possible.
Environment: Unscheduled, is used to sell vehicles, execution cannot be stacked and exploited.
Public: No
Dependencies:
<STRING> ownerX found on vehicles, contains UID of player who bought it.
<ARRAY> Template vehicle arrays, see costs = call {}.

Example:
// From a button control:
action = "if (player == theBoss) then {closeDialog 0; nul = [player,cursorObject] remoteExecCall [""A3A_fnc_sellVehicle"",2]} else {["localize "STR_A3A_Base_sellVehicle_header"", ""Only the Commander can sell vehicles.""] call A3A_fnc_customHint;};";

// Testing spam:
for "_i" from 1 to 1000 do {
    [player,cursorObject] remoteExecCall ["A3A_fnc_sellVehicle",2];
};

Blacklisted Assets

The array below contains classnames of assets which are not allowed to be sold within Antistasi.
Reason for this is that those items are one or more of the following:
- can be aquired by means that don't cost anything and the ability to sell those would be an infinite money exploit.
- are no proper "statics" in terms of weaponized statics but for example the ACE spotting scoped
- something else
